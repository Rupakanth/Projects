## Wall Robot Navigation

A Wall following Robot is desined to move along a wall without hitting.There will be obstacles in its path and the robot has to make decisions which direction to move and roam around the environment in which it is placed.There will be sensors mounted on the robot which are used to calculate the distances of the obstacles and the walls which are fed into the Robot algorithms to make decisions.

The following study on wall following is made Using SCITOS G5 Robot while navigating a room in a clock wise direction for 4 rounds, using 24 ultrasound sensors arranged circularly around its waist.24 ultrasound readings and the simplified distances were collected at the same time step, so each file has the same number of rows (one for each sampling time step)
